Multiplicity is a low-level terraria packet deserialization/serialization library.  It understands Terraria multiplayer messages sent to and from a terraria server, and can translate Terraria packets to and from strongly-typed objects.    It is licensed under GPLv3, and is available as a NuGet package.
